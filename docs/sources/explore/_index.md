# Overview

Explore is your starting point for analyzing, querying and aggregating data in Grafana. It helps you visually explore and iterate until you have a working query or set of queries with which to start building visualizations and doing data analysis. You don't need to create a dashboard if your data source supports graph and table data, as Explore shows the results as both graph or table. This allows for detailed real-time data analysis.
